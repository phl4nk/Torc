# Torc
Multi-threaded Tor onion generator and crawler

### Installation

Torc requires [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/) to be installed and running; also some additional python packages are needed. Install the dependencies via pip and start the script.

```sh
$ python torc.py
```

The script will run until `CTRL+C` is pressed.
